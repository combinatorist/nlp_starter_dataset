						<p>Clear indication of Awusa marginalisation against Igbos in all spheres of life in this country just to appease the likes of Kwankwaso&#8217;s , Nyako&#8217;s and Lamido&#8217;s.<br/>
We have lost out on two good generals without replacement all sacrificed on the so-called national cohesion. This nonsense should be put to rest because my people have sacrificed a lot on blood letting , job denial , altering of deserved positions , lack of federal presence , this country is owned by Awusa Fulani indeed.<br/>
The little opportunity garnered by the South South out of providence is being challenged vehemently using some stooge in the S.W, S.E and S. South to scuttle only but only ever known opportunity.</p>

						<p>It&#8217;s a pity that Ndigbo are being marginalized by their own son, Ihejirika and probably a president of southern extraction. My own Idoma people did not benefit anything from the changes.</p>
