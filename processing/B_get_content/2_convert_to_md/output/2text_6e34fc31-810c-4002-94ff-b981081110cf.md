The Nigeria Army said it would provide its officers and men with an environment conducive for working.

The General Officer Commanding 2 Division of the Nigeria Army, Maj.-Gen. Emmanuel Abejirin, spoke yesterday while inaugurating the rehabilitated facilities at the 4 Brigade of the Army in Benin.

He said the military authorities were not ignorant of the importance of infrastructure in boosting the morale and professionalism of the officers and men.

Abejirin hailed the leadership of the Brigade in providing basic infrastructure to its troops.

The facilities inaugurated included office accommodation, mechanic workshop and houses.

Also inaugurated were refurbished three blocks of 10 classrooms at the Command Children School, Benin.

The Commander, 4 Brigade, Brig.-Gen. Okwudili Azinta, said the rehabilitated classrooms would boost enrolment in school and widen access to education for the children of officers and men.

He said the projects were undertaken to improve accommodation and other infrastructural needs of the command.

Brig.-Gen. Azinta urged the soldiers and other beneficiaries of the projects to make best use of them.
