As part of efforts to create better understanding and synergy among security agencies in Enugu State, the 82 Division of the Nigerian Army, Enugu has organised a joint security exercise for security agencies in the state towards a peaceful election.  
The exercise tagged “Exercise Free Cast”, according to the division, was aimed at developing the ability of the military to operate in conjunction with the Nigeria Police and other security agencies especially before, during and after the forthcoming general elections.  
In his remarks, the chief host and commander, 82 Division Garrison, General S. Mohammed, said he was optimistic that the exercise would prepare all security stakeholders in Enugu State for their assignments before, during and after the forthcoming elections.  
He further disclosed that the exercise would enhance collaboration and esprit de corps among all participants in the area of security in the state, expressing gratitude to the General Officer Commanding \(GOC\), 82 Division for his unflinching support, guidance and untiring efforts towards ensuring the success of the exercise.  
The GOC, Major General Shehu Yusuf, who also spoke at the occasion, commended the commander of 82 Division Garrison for hosting the exercise, assuring that the division would continue to ensure synergy with security agencies within the division’s area of operational responsibility.  
General Yusuf, who was represented by the chief of staff, 82 Division, Brig. Gen. A. Adefarati, urged participants to use the knowledge they acquired to re-train others who were unable to participate in the exercise.
