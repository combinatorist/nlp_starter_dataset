# Soldiers celebrate Christmas in Gwoza, Buni Yadi

On December 26, 20178:37 amIn News by Nwafor PolycarpComments

As has been the tradition, the hierarchy of the Nigerian Army is celebrating this year’s yuletide period with troops in the field.

This time around, the Chief of Army Staff, Lieutenant General TY Buratai, represented by the Chief of Administration \(Army\), Major General IM Alkali, Chief of Civil-Military Affairs, Major General NE Angbazo, Theatre Commander, Operation LAFIYA DOLE, Major General RI Nicholas, General Officer Commanding 7 Division and Director Army Public Relations, Brigadier General SK Usman, along with some of the Principal Staff Officers at Headquarters 7 Division and field commanders are celebrating the 2017 Christmas with the gallant troops of 26 Task Force Brigade, Operation LAFIYA DOLE.

The venue for the celebration is the Headquarters complex of 26 Task Force Brigade, Gwoza in Gwoza Local Government Area of Borno State.

The celebration of the Christmas with the troops apart from boosting troops morale, affords an opportunity to meet and celebrate the season of Christmas \(love\) amongst them in order to foster espirit-de- corps.

Similarly, the Chief of Training and Operations \(Army\), Major General DD Ahmadu led another team to Headquarters 27 Task Force Brigade, Buni Yadi, Yobe State, where they celebrated the Christmas with the troops.
