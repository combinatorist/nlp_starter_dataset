No fewer than 700 officers and soldiers of the Nigerian Army are set for deployment for peace keeping operation in Liberia, just as the Army authority has warned the troops to prevent Ebola through hygienic living

The troops were warned to avoid any act capable of dragging the image of Nigeria and Nigerian Army to the mud, as the army will not accept a situation where its soldiers are seen as soft targets.

General Officer Commanding \(GOC\) 1 Division, Nigerian Army, Major General Kenneth Osuji gave the warning while addressing the troops at the graduation ceremony marking the end of their pre-deployment training in Jaji, Kaduna State on Friday.

‎General Osuji who is the GOC of the 1 Brigade, which is made up of the Nigerian Battalion \(NIBATT\)36 in the United Nations Mission in Liberia \(UNMIL\) said, they must work with the rules of engagement of the mission and respect the cultural and religious sensitivity of Liberia people.

According to him, “Be reminded that the Nigerian Army will not accept any situation where its troops are seen as soft targets or conducting themselves in unprofessional manner such as trafficking in illicit substances of any kind including alcohol and drugs.

“Additionally, you must respect the cultural and religious sensitivity of the people of Liberia. You must exhibit the highest sense of personal/environmental hygiene as Liberia is just emerging from an EBOLA epidemic,” the GOC stressed.

Lord Ring, It was only you whose mother’s house was on fire and you are running after rates, we have grievous problem in North East were our people are dying every day in en-mass and we needed soldiers for the work to quench the problem and you are sending soldiers to Liberia. We must remove dirty in our eyes first b4 removing someone’s own.

    * Terry

Thank you. Thsee 700 form a Battalion but in the north east a Battalion consist of 70. I know you will be surprised. But that is what is on ground. The present should also dissolve the military board and flush operations department without further dalay to safe this country from cruelty. 

  * Hinds Peter

That’s the Bible.”remove the moke out of your own eye.Before removing the beam out of your brother’s eye”.But the Bible also say’s.”if your brother sins seventy times seven forgive him”.It will be an enjoyable excursion for the boys.Which I am sure they\(the soldiers\) will be looking forward to.Weigh each situation with a precise balance.Then act decisively.Get to know the culture of Liberia.At some points becoming a Liberian.You have been sent as umpires in the game of life.Live up to that.I am sure your training will do the rest for you.So “bon voyage”\(good by\).Unity is Strength.Peter Carlos Hinds.Councilor.
