#### GOC, Brigade Commander Move To Liberate Monguno

By Kareem Haruna

— Feb 15, 2015 | 5 Comments

Three weeks after Boko Haram terrorists have taken Monguno town and sacked everyone therein, credible insider information obtained by Leadership Sunday suggests that troops to be led by top military officers that include the GOC 7 division, MG Adeosun and BG Udoh, Brigade Commander of 5 brigade, Mungonu, have been mobilized to recapture the town anytime soon.

It could be recalled that Monguno town fell under the conquest of Boko Haram on the 25th of January, this year.

The seizure of Monguno had caused the death of hundreds of residents including soldiers and forced over 5000 others to flee their homes into Maiduguri where most of them are currently taking refuge in IDP camps.

A ranked soldier serving at the 7 Division of the Nigerian Army, Maiduguri yesterday confirmed to Leadership Sunday that Monguno town is about to be liberated following the deployment and mobilization of troops to ensure that the border town is recaptured back under the control of the Nigerian security.

“I can assure that any moment from now, though I cannot be definite about time, the GOC and the Brigade Commander would be leading troops that are already on ground to recapture Monguno”, the officer whose name cannot be mentioned said.

“This operation which will be replicated in other captured communities afterwards, has zero tolerance for failure because it being ordered by the C in C himself.

Monguno is about 143km northwest of Maiduguri, and the military formation there \(Reccee Battalion\) became the second largest barrack in the state after the 7 Division headquarters in Maiduguri was established in 2013.

If the move to liberate Monguno has not been made by the soldiers up to this morning, would this story not have divulged the information to the insurgents? Our media men should please learn to cooperate with the army and other security men on matters of security, especially in times of war such as this.

  * FAKA DATOBO

Those who divulged military information are the boko-haram within the military.This is most unfortunate.
