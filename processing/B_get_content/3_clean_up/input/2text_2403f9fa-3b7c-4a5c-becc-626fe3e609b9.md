# Military releases 275 suspected Boko Haram detainees

On February 13, 20162:30 amIn News by IkennaComments

BY NDAHI MARAMA, MAIDUGURI

The Theatre Commander of the Operation Lafiya Dole in the North East, Major General Hassan Umar has released 275 suspected members of Boko Haram sect who have been into detention for quite sometime.

The release of the suspects according to the Theatre Commander followed a thorough interrogation by the security outfit.

Addressing the released suspects in the presence of Governor Kashim Shettima at the Parade Ground of the 212 Battalion, Maimalari Cantonment in Maiduguri on Friday, General Umar insisted that, continued detention of these suspects would hurt military/civil relations in the fight against insurgency.

“In line with principle of justice, equity and fairness, these 275 suspects after undergoing thorough interrogations, we found out that they have no reason to stay in detention, but to be released with immediate effect so that they will reunite with their families and become useful to the society. “The detainees comprised of 142 males, 49 females, 22 under-aged boys, 50 under-aged girls, 2 Nigerien and 2 Cameroonians”.

“We want to use this opportunity to congratulate all the freed suspects and I urge them to shun any act of violence in any society they found themselves.

“I want to also commend the effort of our security outfit, particularly the interrogating team whose unflinching support led to the release of these suspects we are all witnessing today”.
