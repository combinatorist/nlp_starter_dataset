... Reposition to Attain Combat Readiness

 

The Defence Headquarters has restructured the Operation Lafiya Dole in the North East to reposition it for more efficiency, effectiveness and combat readiness in the discharge of its assigned tasks of crushing the remnant of terrorists.

Consequently, a new Theatre Commander has been appointed. He is Major General Hassan Umoru. Until his appointment, General Umoru was the General Officer Commanding, 3 Division Nigerian Army. Also appointed is the Deputy Theatre Commander who is Major General Lucky Irabor. The changes are part of the reorganisation by the Defence Headquarters in line with the force restructuring of its operations to attain the overall objectives of the Chief of Defence Staff.

The aim of this new development is to restrategise and inject new tactics to the existing operational procedures with the aim of finally knocking out the terrorists who now devised means of hitting soft targets through suicide bombings and isolated attacks on remote villages.

Operation Lafiya Dole will continue to be responsive until all elements of terrorists are finally crushed.
